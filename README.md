1.	 Home screen :- Which it the first screen to appear when one opens the app .
2.	 Profile Page :- It allows the user to choose whether he is a Civilian or a Worker for the job.
3a. Civilian Login Page:- Login Page for Civilian.
3b. Worker Login Page:- Login Page for Worker.
4. Civilian Activity :- Interactive Map Activity to detect potholes near him/her.
